# TITLE “Smart” Supply Chain

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

EximChain

* When was the company incorporated? 

The project was kicked off in 2015, but more or less became established in 2017, which is when the founding team began working full time.

* Who are the founders of the company?

Hope Liu & Juan Huertas

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

MIT students/graduates and launched it from the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative and an accelerator called Plug and Play Fintech Accelerator

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

The company initially obtained $100,000 in funding from MIT
They recently raised $20M in 2018. The funding was led by FBG Capital, a major cryptocurrency hedge fund from China. Other participants included INBlockchain, a blockchain capital firm founded by Li Xiaolai (a Chinese cryptocurrency activist) and Hong Kong-based investment firm Kenetic Capital.

## Business Activities:

An Enterprise smart supply chain solution for supply chain planning, supply chain financing, supply chain risk and quality assurance

 

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Their goal is to become the blockchain infrastructure for supply chain applications, to fill in the gap of over $5.2trn lost in potential revenue each year, due to the lack of transparency, connectivity, and agility in the global supply chain industry. 


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

When Eximchain was first announced, its whitepaper focused on supply chain finance for SMEs. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that SMEs in developing countries face a $2 trillion financing gap. However, the platform has two other targets: sourcing suppliers and logistics/inventory management.

In China alone, the vast majority of the 40 million SMEs remain underserved by existing financial resources. The financing gap is particularly concerning because SMEs contribute to up to 60% of total employment and up to 40% of GDP in developing markets

A 2015 McKinsey report suggests that a $20B revenue pool exists for implemented SCF programs, with only $2B being captured today.


What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

To attract financiers for supply chain funding, they need a volume of SMEs on the platform. And to attract the SMEs, they need to have funders in place. Hence startups that target this sector such as Tradeshift and Taulia focus on the enterprise buyers which provides access to their SME suppliers. And that’s perhaps why Eximchain has expanded its focus beyond finance, to get more businesses onto the platform. By targeting networks of companies or enterprises, they can attract the numbers of SMEs they need.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

First off this is a public permissioned blockchain. It’s a little like Hedera Hashgraph in that way. Eximchain uses the Quorum variant of Ethereum developed by JP Morgan. The bank developed Quorum to get around the privacy issues with public blockchains because businesses don’t want everyone to be able to see their details such as invoices.

In a permissionless public blockchain, anyone can set up a node and start participating. In contrast, for Eximchain, every node has to register to participate. 
Eximchain uses Quadratic Voting which avoids the downsides of a simple majority. To vote, tokens need to be staked. If someone feels strongly about an issue, they could vote multiple times. But every additional vote requires a stake that’s exponentially more. It’s squared. So if the first vote costs two, the second vote would be two squared and so on. After the vote, the tokens are equally distributed to the voters.
Eximchain offers a platform to implement smart contract based SCF solutions on a permissioned fork of Ethereum
supporting data privacy. Our ecosystem will enable SMEs to gain access to a_ordable capital sources by giving financiers visibility into the supply chain cash ow. The first game theory-based application we plan to build, Multi-Party Dynamic Contracting* be designed in such a way that no partner can improve his profit by deciding to deviate from the optimal set of decisions. That is, there is no incentive for the buyer, the supplier, nor the financier to deviate from the set of actions that will achieve the globally optimal solution. The implementation is executed by the consensus of the network in a standard, automated, private, and auditable fashion. From the user's perspective, after making the initial input and setting up the negotiation rule, they can receive the negotiation result from a \black box" where the system automatically executes an optimization engine through multi-stage coordination until Nash Equilibrium is reached and each participant's incentive is aligned.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Supply chain finance

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Creating of an entire supply chain technology stack, tons of block chain trade and trade finance platforms, IoT solutions, commercial bank network embracing block chain solutions.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

We.trade is the consortium of 12 banks where the initial focus is on European SMEs. And unicorn Tradeshift is getting ready to launch their SME blockchain platform. The latter already has 1.5m businesses ready to go from their primary platform which they plan to integrate seamlessly.
Additionally, startup Centrifuge raised $3.8m in March for a blockchain project targeting the same sector. The founding team was behind financial supply chain company Taulia.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

It’s really hard to say based on the private nature of the company’s business activities.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Because of the supply chain optimization nature of this solution, the performance metric is primarily driven by the surplus value created by shifting supply chain transaction terms from individual maximization based to joint optimization. The multiple parties involved in the negotiation set the metrics.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

EximChain is small and later to the game compared with more established trade finance focused fintech companies, but they are trying to solve an entirely different problem. Most players in this space are using a platform model and focusing on making disintermediated trade and trade finance to be more secure, streamlined, automated. 

Even Taulia, which is the only player in this comp set which focuses on supply chain optimization, is merely doing this from a client facing software which facilitates internal company financial management while providing a link to a network of supply chain finance.

What’s unique about EximChain is their game-theoretic algorithms which allow for multi-party supply chain optimization conducted by an unbiased algorithmic decision maker. This requires each party to yield decision making power regarding the negotiation of supply contracts by pre-agreeing to end negotiation upon a Nash Equilibrium is attained based on the negotiating rules set by each party.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I think offering the DeFi asset finance Dapp like Centrifuge does would help expand access to finance and drive down costs.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

I don’t really have the expertise to advise this company on what they should be doing.
